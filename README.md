# XML University Course

This mini project explores the design and use of XML as a semi-structured data format.
It demonstrates:

- Hierarchical data modelling using XML
- Well-formed and valid XML documents
- The use of attributes vs elements
- XPath navigation and existential query semantics
- Structure enforcement using Document Type Definitions (DTDs)

The project is designed as a conceptual learning exercise aligned with database theory,
rather than a full application.
